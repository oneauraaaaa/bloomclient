# BLOOM

### THIS PROJECT IS NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED!
I just forked this from https://github.com/btg3hvyg5b9rtzbzen4j/fusion/ and added just two features which are ESP colors and blockhit

Press `Insert` to open the menu once it is injected.

### Notices
- This cheat only works on Lunar Client 1.8.9
- The ESP in works well in third person until your camera starts colliding with blocks, a solution was found however it was not very reliable.
- After having fusion injected for a while, you may experience minor lag spikes, no solution was found.
- Might give bunch of errors whenever you click the combat tab.

### How to inject
Rename the builded DLL to bloomclient.dll and put in the same directory as the injector exe to inject.

oneaura (me): Added blockhit and customizable esp colors.
